# Palanquin Spec Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clear, maintainable, and well-documented. Code reviews are mandatory to enforce quality standards.

### II. Testing Standards
A comprehensive test suite must accompany all code. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience must be consistent across the entire application. A design system and style guide must be followed.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. Performance testing is required for all new features and critical code paths.

## Governance
All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Any deviation from these principles must be justified and documented.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Set the date of initial adoption. | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-19
