\title{Palanquin Mobile App}
\maketitle

\section{Summary}

Palanquin is a customer relationship management software for the real estate industry, with a

focus on Real Estate Developers and Home Builders. Our clients are some of the largest real

estate developers in North America.

Our application is web-based and optimized for the desktop, although all features are

accessible via mobile devices (although not always in a pleasant way.) The app supports

marketing and sales efforts, allowing clients to guide their sales team by generating activities

(such as “send email” or “call lead”) when a lead reaches a certain stage (e.g. receives an “A”

rating) and to undertake marketing activities (e.g. send mass mails to a list of leads.)

Leads are either manually entered by the sales staff, or created through on of our integrations

with lead-nurturing tools. Once a lead has converted to a purchaser, we pass them off to

contract management applications. Integrations with 3rd-party services are core to our

business.

Especially important are reports that track sales progress and sales team performance. To

provide good insights, the data the reports access has to be up-to-date and reliable. However,

most sales staff are used to using their mobile devices automatically syncing completed

appointments, phone calls or text messages. We currently require those items to be manually

entered, which has a high risk of creating unreliable or invalid data (as most manual processes

do), and also causes frustration and friction for sales reps. Instead of making their job easier

and assisting in reaching conversion goals, we take precious time away by requiring tedious

data entry.

A mobile app with close integration into the mobile operating system would alleviate most

concerns around manual data entry, and allow us to actually create value for sales reps.
